	My ongoing research program, which has been very successful to date, concerns the combinatorial and computational aspects of algebraic topology with modern applications to topological data analysis and quantum physics, and, as a member of Kathryn Hess' group, I wrote the mathematical content of a grant approved for over \mbox{1 million USD}.
