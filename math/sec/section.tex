A purposeful construction of a model for the $E_\infty$-operad is central in most contexts where commutativity up-to-coherent-homotopies plays a role.
So far we have focused on the arity 2 part of an $E_\infty$-coalgebra on the chains of simplicial and globular sets.
I will effectively describe in this section the entirety of this structure using a novel model introduced in \cite{medina2020prop1}.
The advantage of this over previous models \cite{berger2004combinatorial, mcclure2003multivariable, kriz1995operads} is that it can be described in terms of finitely many generators and relations.

To illustrate props and operads, the theory of groups serves as a useful analogy.
Let $V$ be a vector space or more generaly a module.
Composition in $\mathrm{Aut}(V)$ defines a group structure, and homomorphisms from an abstract group to $\mathrm{Aut}(V)$ define representations.
We can consider the composition structure of $\mathrm{End}(V) = \bigoplus_{m,n \geq 0} \mathrm{Hom}(V^{\tensor m}, V^{\tensor n})$ together with the permutation actions of $\Sigma_n$ and $\Sigma_m$.
The resulting structure gives rise to the notion of prop and when restricted to $m = 1$ or $n = 1$ to that of an operad.
We use the same notation $\mathrm{End}$ for these three different constructions.
Structure preserving morphisms from an abstract prop or operad to $\mathrm{End}(V)$ define respectively the notions of prop bialgebra or operad (co)algebra.
In a similar way to how groups can be defined in terms of generators and relations, we can define a presentation of an abstract prop.
For complete details in the operad case see \cite{loday2012operads}.

\begin{definition}[\cite{medina2020prop1}]
	Let $\mathcal M$ be the prop generated by
	$$\counit \in \mathcal S(1,0)_0\hspace*{.6cm}\coproduct \in \mathcal S(1,2)_0\hspace*{.6cm} \product \in \mathcal S(2,1)_1$$
	with differential $$\partial\ \counit=0\hspace*{.6cm}\partial\ \coproduct=0\hspace*{.6cm}\partial\ \product=\ \boundary$$
	and restricted by the relations $$\productcounit\hspace*{.6cm}\leftcounitality\hspace*{.6cm}\rightcounitality$$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} [\cite{medina2020prop1}]
	One of the operads associated to $\mathcal M$ is an $E_\infty$-operad.
\end{theorem}

I used this finitely presented prop to describe an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the chains of any simplicial set induced by only three operations: the Alexander-Whitney diagonal, the augmentation map, and an algebraic version of the join of simplices.
Additionally, I showed that the operad associated to a finitely presented quotient of $\mathcal M$ is isomorphic up to signs to the Surjection operad of McClure-Smith \cite{mcclure2003multivariable} and Berger-Fresse \cite{berger2004combinatorial}.
In \cite{medina2018prop2}, I constructed a prop in the category of CW-spaces whose cellular chains are isomorphic to $\mathcal M$ and used it to prove a conjecture of Kaufmann, Remark 4.11 of \cite{kaufmann2009dimension}, establishing an isomorphism between the chains of an arc operad and the Surjection operad.

\section{Chain level Steenrod operations}
In \cite{medina2020maysteenrod}, using an operadic viewpoint, we provide a generalization of the cup-$i$ products to all Steenrod operations \cite{steenrod1962cohomology}.
Let $\mathrm C_r$ be the cyclic group of order $r$ and $\mathrm C$ be the groupoid obtained by disjoint union of all the $\mathrm C_r$.
The core construction in our paper is a \textit{Steenrod-Adem structure} on the $E_\infty$-operad associated to my prop $\mathcal M$, that is to say, a morphism of $\mathrm C$-modules to it from $\mathcal W$, the $\mathrm C$-module defined by letting $\mathcal W(r)$ be the minimal resolution of $\Z/r\Z$ as a trivial $(\Z/r\Z)[\mathrm C_r]$-module.
We also construct Steenrod-Adem structures on the Barratt-Eccles and surjections operad, an natural Steenrod-Adem structures on the normalized chains of simplicial and cubical sets.

\section{Open-source projects}

\subsection{\texttt{giotto-tda}} As a result of a collaborative effort between L2F SA, the Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience at EPFL, and the Institute of Reconfigurable Embedded Digital Systems (REDS) of HEIG-VD, we developed \texttt{giotto-tda}, a \texttt{Python} library that integrates high-performance topological data analysis with machine learning via a \emph{scikit-learn}--compatible API and state-of-the-art \texttt{C++} implementations \cite{medina2021giotto}.
The team, lead by Kathryn Hess, consists of machine learning practitioners, mathematicians and experts on high-performance computing.
The PyPI package is downloaded 350 times per month and the library appears in \emph{scikit-learn}'s curated list of related projects.
The paper has been accepted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research and was presented during NeuRIPS 2020.

\subsection{\texttt{ComCH}} Commutativity up-to-coherent-homotopies plays a crucial role in the study of configuration spaces.
The topological operad of little cubes is homotopy equivalent to these spaces, and can be effectively represented in the category of chain complexes, with its compositional structure, by filtrations on the Barratt-Eccles and surjection operads.
I implemented these models as part of \texttt{ComCH}, computer algebra system written in \texttt{Python} for the study of commutativity up-to-coherent-homotopies, where I also implemented the novel constructions introduced in \cite{medina2020maysteenrod} related to the homology of symmetric groups.

\section{Information theory and harmonic analysis}

Network representations often cannot fully account for the structural richness of complex systems spanning multiple levels of organization.
Recently proposed high-order information-theoretic signals are well-suited to capture synergistic phenomena that transcend pairwise interactions; however, the exponential-growth of their cardinality severely hinders their applicability.
In \cite{medina2021hyperharmonic}, a paper in which I am the first author, we combined methods from harmonic analysis and combinatorial topology to construct efficient representations of high-order information-theoretic signals.
The core of our method is the diagonalization of a discrete version of the Laplace-de Rham operator, that geometrically encodes structural properties of the system.
We capitalize these ideas by developing a complete workflow for the construction of hyperharmonic representations of high-order signals, which is applicable to a wide range of scenarios.
As a proof of concept, we illustrated our approach  analyzing the musical scores of the latter symphonies written by F.J. Hadyn, where our results demonstrate the far superior dimensionality-reduction capabilities of our method compared to other representations.
