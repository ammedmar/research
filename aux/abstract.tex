\begin{abstract}
	My ongoing research program, which has been very successful to date, concerns the combinatorial, geometric, and computational aspects of algebraic topology with impact in data science and field theory among other areas. As a member of Kathryn Hess' group, I wrote the mathematical content of a grant approved for over 1 million USD.
