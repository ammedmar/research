\begin{abstract}
	My ongoing research program concerns the combinatorial, geometric, and computational aspects of algebraic topology with impact, among other areas, in data science and field theory. As a member of Kathryn Hess' group, I wrote the mathematical content of a grant approved for over 1~million~USD.
